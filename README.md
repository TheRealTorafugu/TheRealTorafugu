# Torafugu the *Fishy* Bot Developer

## About Me

* Main project is a Discord bot called [Puffer](https://dsc.gg/puffer) (No public repository).
* 18 years old (This will update as I get older lol).
* Was a programmer for a FIRST Robotics Competition Team for a year.
* Not confirmed to be a fish, but not out of the question either.
* Pronouns are he/him
* You can contact me through @torafugu on Discord

## Projects

* Puffer (Discord bot made using Python and the Nextcord library)
* That one Linux rice that is actually a public repository on my profile (Lazy enough to not link it).


## Socials

* [Discord](https://discord.gg/VfySXNKRay) (A server I made for Puffer)
* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/TorafuguBotDev) (Calling it "X" makes it seem like a *different* site)
